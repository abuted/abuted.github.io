## Introduction

UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 make it easier and faster for developers to build websites. Learning them can be quite hard if you're used to writing your own HTML and CSS. But, using UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5 saves a lot of time because you don't have to create everything from scratch. Without a framework, designing a website will take much more time, and you will have problems like the site not appearing good on different devices. UI frameworks save you from this problem by giving you resources so your website can look good on different devices without writing too much extra code.

## My Experience with Bootstrap 5

When I first started with Bootstrap 5, there were certain parts that seemed confusing to me. Since I was dealing with something different from the approach with HTML and CSS, learning how to use the grid system and all the class names has helped me. After knowing how to make these components work, I am able to do a responsive layout a bit quicker.

I think one of the best things about Bootstrap is the prebuilt components it offers the user. Rather than having to design buttons, forms, and navigation bars for hours, I can use Bootstrap's pre-designed components and easily change them if I need too. It has saved me a lot of much time and makes my projects look professional with so little effort.

## Why Use Bootstrap 5?

Bootstrap 5 is one of the most well-known UI frameworks. One if its main features is the grid system that helps you when developing websites so that the user can easily switch between different screen sizes. 

The other nice thing in Bootstrap is the set of pre-designed components like buttons, forms, navigation bars that you can quickly include on your site. These components looks good right when you use them, but it can also be customized to fit your design. This saves a lot of time because you do not need to develop every part of the site from scratch.

## Why Not  Just Use Raw HTML and CSS?

Of course, there may be cases where it would be wise to use raw HTML and CSS. For example, smaller projects that have very specific design requirements may not require the tools that Bootstrap has to offer. You can write custom code in order to gain more control of your designs.

However, for most projects, something like Bootstrap is a better option. It allows developers to create more responsive and maintainable websites. Using a framework saves time by handling common tasks for you, so you don't have to figure out how to implement them on your own.

## Software Engineering Benefits

From a software engineering perspective, the UI frameworks provide a lot of advantages for larger projects. An advantage is that it helps with scalability, where large websites are often grown over time by adding features and contents. Bootstrap would make this scaling a lot easier to maintain. Its reusable components reduces the need to constantly write new code for each part of your site.

Another advantage about using UI frameworks is that it helps with maintainability. The Bootstrap layout makes the code easier to understand and maintainable. That’s why it can be very helpful when several developers are working on the same project. By following the same design conventions and using the same tools, teams can avoid making mistakes within the website.

## A Webpage Built With a UI Framework 

The navigation system is an important part of any website, helping users easily find different sections of the site. For example, this website by Hawaii’s Finest uses a UI framework like Bootstrap 5, as shown in the code snippet below:

```
<nav class="header-nav-list"> 
    <div class="header-nav-item header-nav-item--collection header-nav-item--active header-nav-item--homepage">
      <a href="/" data-animation-role="header-element" aria-current="page">Home</a>
    </div>
    <div class="header-nav-item header-nav-item--external">
      <a href="https://shop.hifinest.com" data-animation-role="header-element">Shop</a>
    </div>
    <div class="header-nav-item header-nav-item--folder">
      <a class="header-nav-folder-title" href="/thecollective" tabindex="-1" data-animation-role="header-element">The Collective</a>
      <div class="header-nav-folder-content">
        <div class="header-nav-folder-item header-nav-folder-item--external">

    <div class="header-nav-item header-nav-item--collection">
      <a href="/events" data-animation-role="header-element">Events</a>
    </div>
    <div class="header-nav-item header-nav-item--folder">
      <a class="header-nav-folder-title" href="/about-us" tabindex="-1" data-animation-role="header-element">Info</a>
      <div class="header-nav-folder-content">
        <div class="header-nav-folder-item">
          <a href="/about"><span class="header-nav-folder-item-content">About Us</span></a>
        </div>
        <div class="header-nav-folder-item">
          <a href="/faq"><span class="header-nav-folder-item-content">FAQ</span></a>
        </div>
        <div class="header-nav-folder-item">

        <div class="header-nav-folder-item header-nav-folder-item--external">
          <a href="https://www.hrsymphony.com/hrs/careers/hifinest">Careers</a>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
</nav>
```
