## Overview
**The Problem**  
Students often struggle to keep track of their courses, syllabuses, and assignment deadlines across multiple platforms or formats. This can lead to missed deadlines and confusion about course materials.

**The Solution**  
We propose a webpage that combines all relevant academic information for a student. This personalized webpage will display all registered classes, provide easy access to syllabuses, and feature an integrated calendar highlighting important dates such as homework and project deadlines. A secure login system will ensure that each student sees only their information.

## Names of the Proposers
-  Alessandra Gudoy, Alexis Karl Buted

## Mockup Page Ideas
- **Dashboard**: Displays a summary of current classes, quick links to syllabuses, and a snapshot of upcoming deadlines.
- **Classes Tab**: Lists all registered courses with links to detailed course information, including instructor contact details and office hours.
- **Syllabuses Tab**: Provides direct access to downloadable or viewable syllabuses for each course.
- **Calendar Tab**: Features a visually intuitive calendar that marks due dates for assignments, tests, and projects. It includes color-coded categories for different types of tasks.

## Use Case Ideas
- **A student checks their upcoming assignments**: Logging into the webpage, a student can quickly navigate to the Calendar tab to view all due dates.
- **A student needs to download the syllabus**: By accessing the Syllabuses tab, a student can easily find and download the syllabus for any course.
- **A student reviews their course list**: In the Classes tab, the student can see a comprehensive list of their registered courses along with relevant details like meeting times and instructor information.

## Beyond the Basics
- **Integration with School Systems**: The webpage could be integrated with the school's learning management system to automatically update course information and assignment deadlines.
- **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Ensuring the webpage is mobile-responsive will allow students to access their information conveniently from any device.
- **Notification System**: Implementing a notification system that reminds students of upcoming deadlines through email or push notifications can enhance the tool's utility.
