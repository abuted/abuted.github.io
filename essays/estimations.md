## How did you make your effort estimates?

To estimate the effort needed for tasks, our team broke the work down into smaller parts. We found out that some of the tasks that we created, were similar to the experience WODs and assignments that we completed in the past. At the start of the project, we held planning meetings where everyone shared their ideas based on past experience with similar tasks. This process was similar to assignments we've done in class before, where we estimated how long it would take to finish certain tasks. Even though the projects were different, the way we planned our work and discussed it with the team helped us come up with estimates.

## Even though your estimates were always off, sometimes way off, was there any benefit from making effort estimates for the issues in advance? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Even though our estimates were often wrong, making them in advance helped in many ways. One of the main benefits was that it gave the team a common understanding of what needed to be done. Even if the estimates were off, we could prioritize tasks, decide who would work on what, and set expectations for the project’s progress. Having an initial estimate also gave us a way to track how the project was moving forward. It helped us spot potential problems early and adjust our plans if needed. Making estimates also helped us get better at estimating in the future. When we saw that our estimates weren’t accurate, we could learn from the mistakes and improve how we estimate in the future.

## Was there any benefit for tracking the actual effort expended on the issues? If so, what benefits? If not, why not?

Tracking the actual effort was very helpful for a few reasons. First, it allowed us to compare our original estimates with the real time spent on tasks. This helped us see where we had over or under-estimated the work. For example, some tasks that seemed simple at first took more time than expected because of unexpected issues, while other tasks were easier than we thought. Tracking actual effort also helped us stay on track with the project. It showed us whether we were meeting deadlines or needed to adjust how we faced the problems. This made it easier to inform team members and clarify if we were behind schedule or if adjustments were needed.

## How did you track your actual effort? How accurate do you believe your tracking was?

We tracked our actual effort using the iPhone stopwatch and the Google Timer. Each team member would start the stopwatch when they began a task and stop it when they finished. This method was simple, and it helped us keep track of how much time we spent on each task. For tasks that needed more specific timing, we used the Google Timer to set a certain amount of time and focused on that task. While this tracking method worked well, it wasn’t always 100% accurate. Sometimes team members would forget to start or stop the timer, or they might round the time to a whole number to make it easier. Even with these small mistakes, the tracking system gave us a good idea of how much time we were spending on each task, and it helped us adjust our plans for the project.
