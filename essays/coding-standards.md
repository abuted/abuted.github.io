## Introduction

Coding standards often seem minor. Talking about things like indentation, line breaks, and naming conventions can feel unimportant. However, I believe that coding standards are important for effective software development, especially when working with TypeScript. A good way to improve software quality is to practice following coding standards. These guidelines do more than make code look the same, but they also help create an environment for learning, teamwork, and better code.

## Learning with Coding Standards

When starting with TypeScript, the different kinds of syntax and features can be overwhelming. Clear coding standards act as a guide, helping new programmers navigate these challenges. They reinforce good practices, making it easier to understand how TypeScript works. For example, using consistent naming helps clarify what each variable or function does, making it easier to remember how to use TypeScript features. This clearness is important when multiple developers are working together.

## My Experience with ESLint in VSCode

After using ESLint with TypeScript in Visual Studio Code for a week, my view on coding standards has changed. At first, I faced many ESLint errors that felt overwhelming. However, as I worked through them, I began to see their value. Each error became a chance for me to learn, showing me where I could improve my understanding of TypeScript. Fixing these issues has not only improved my coding style but also helped me understand the best practices in TypeScript. Sometimes, fixing ESLint errors felt frustrating, especially when I had to change code that was already working to follow style rules. But, this challenge turned out to be helpful the more I engaged with ESLint’s feedback. By learning these standards, it lead to a cleaner and easier-to-maintain code. Instead of seeing ESLint as a burden, I now view it as a helpful tool guiding me towards improving my code.

## The Benefits of Consistency

A key advantage of coding standards is the consistency they introduce to a project. When multiple developers work on a TypeScript project, different coding styles can create confusion and lead to mistakes. Consistent coding standards help everyone understand the code better, allowing team members to read, review, and modify each other’s work more easily. This teamwork boosts productivity and makes it easier to follow different styles. Well-organized and consistently formatted TypeScript code is easier to maintain, which allows future developers to adapt and expand it quickly. Using coding standards goes beyond technical advantages, but it creates a focus of quality within the development team. When everyone follows the same practices, it creates a sense of responsibility. Developers become more aware of their work and aim for quality in the code they write.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, coding standards are very important in programming, especially when working with TypeScript. They help improve learning, encourage teamwork, and make code easier to maintain. My experience using ESLint with TypeScript has shown me how useful coding standards are for both personal growth and team success. As we work through the challenges of TypeScript and team projects, we should see coding standards as helpful tools in creating great software.
