It structures the data into a graph, where users and posts are nodes, and interactions like comments, views, and references are edges.
The program highlights important posts and users, identifies trending posts, filters content based on keywords and user attributes, and generates word clouds to visually represent word frequency in the filtered content. The goal is to help users extract insights, understand engagement patterns, and visually analyze the most relevant content from the data.


## What is the Social Media Networks?

The Social Media Networks program organizes and analyzes social media data by constructing a graph to model relationships between users and posts. It starts by building a graph structure where nodes represent users and posts, and edges depict interactions like authorship, commenting, and viewing. The graph is enhanced by adding relationships between posts that quote or refer to each other. It then identifies important posts based on view counts, notable users based on engagement metrics, and trending posts by combining comments and views into a score. Filtered posts are analyzed to generate a word cloud that visually represents word frequency based on specific criteria. The final results include a summary of the top posts, interesting users, and trending content, providing insights into the most significant interactions and trends in the data.

## What was my role?

In this project, I played a crucial role in developing and implementing a system for analyzing and visualizing social media data. I started by creating a graph structure to model relationships between users and posts, with nodes representing users and posts and edges illustrating interactions like authorship, commenting, and viewing. I enhanced the graph by adding edges to capture quoting and referring interactions between posts. My analyses identified important posts based on view counts, notable users through engagement metrics, and trending posts by combining comments and views into a score. I also filtered posts according to specific criteria and generated a word cloud to visually represent word frequency. Finally, I summarized key insights, presenting the top posts, interesting users, and trending content to provide a comprehensive overview of the data. 

## What did I learn?

From this project, I learned how to model social media interactions by creating a graph structure that represents relationships between users and posts, including interactions like authorship, commenting, and viewing. I discovered how to enhance the graph by adding edges to capture complex relationships between posts, such as quoting and referring. I gained experience in performing data analysis to identify key posts, notable users, and trending content by examining metrics such as view counts, engagement, and a combined score of comments and views. I also learned to filter and process data based on specific criteria, such as keywords and user attributes, and to generate visual representations like word clouds to illustrate word frequency. The project taught me how to use data visualization techniques to summarize and present key insights, making it easier to understand trends and significant content.
