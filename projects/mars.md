For sightings, users fill out a form with information on the animal, its environment, and photos. Allows you to report sightings of marine wildlife in distress, sends your location to HMAR, and allows you to send images and information to help the animal.

For emergencies, users are provided with contact information to HMAR. In both options, HMAR is notified with the information needed to best support the animal reported. Allows HMAR volunteer to look through submissions via spreadsheet and provides them with information on animal (i.e. location, injury) to best help the animal.
