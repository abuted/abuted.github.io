This program is a hotel management system designed to handle tasks like booking rooms, checking in and out customers, and keeping track of room availability. It allows hotel staff to add and manage room information, associate customers with rooms, and calculate payments based on the length of stay. 
The system can also search for available rooms, find customer details, and generate reports on current guests. Overall, it streamlines the management of hotel operations, making it easier to organize bookings and ensure efficient customer service.

What is the Hotel Management System?

This Hotel management System program is designed to manage a hotel's room bookings and customer information. It allows hotel staff to add rooms, check in customers, and check out customers. The program tracks available rooms and can search for specific rooms or customers. It provides a summary report of all customers currently checked in. The system handles room management, including adding and deleting rooms. It also manages customer details during check-in and check-out, calculating payments based on room rates and the length of stay. Users interact with the system through a menu-driven interface. The system helps streamline hotel operations by keeping track of both room and customer information.

What was my role?

In the process of making this program, I developed a hotel management system in C++ with my teammates. I was involved in designing and implementing features to manage room bookings and customer details. I coded some functionalities for adding and deleting rooms, checking in and checking out customers, and tracking available rooms. I also helped to create a user interface to interact with the system through a menu. My responsibilities included ensuring the system calculates payments accurately and generates customer reports. I also tested the program to ensure it worked correctly and made improvements as needed. My work helped streamline hotel operations by organizing and managing room and customer information.

What did I learn?

In developing the hotel management system, I learned key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), including how to use classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to manage room and customer data. I gained experience in handling and manipulating information by implementing functionalities to add, update, and delete records. Designing a menu-driven interface taught me how to create user interactions within the program. I also developed skills in functional programming by coding specific tasks like checking in customers, calculating payments, and generating reports. Error handling became crucial as I managed user inputs and addressed potential issues. Implementing algorithms for searching, sorting, and managing data helped me understand how to efficiently organize information. Finally, I learned that working in a group can help me get the program done faster and it allows peer inputs to be put to good use.
